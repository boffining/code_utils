# Hello CodeHealer Target Repo

This tiny repository is designed to exercise the default CodeHealer workflow. It contains a
single script, `app.py`, that prints a greeting. After the healer finishes running you can
validate success by executing:

```bash
python app.py
```

Expected output:

```
Hello from the CodeHealer target repo!
```
